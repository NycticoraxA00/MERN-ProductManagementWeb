# Product Management Website

A full-stack website using the MERN stack  involves several components that work together to provide a seamless shopping experience.

## Technology:
- MongoDB for flexible database using documents
- ExpressJS for request handling
- ReactJS for building Front-end UI
- NodeJS for Back-end logic

## Features:
- User can perform CRUD(Create new, Read, Update, Delete) operations on each products' informantions
- Notification using Chakra UIâ€™s Toast.
- Global state management with Zustand

## Further Development:
The website can further develop more features to become an E-commerce website such as adding purchasing features, adding to cart, searching for products for users that are buyers, and keeping existing CRUD features available exclusively for the website administrator.
